### About Me 
![my profile picture](/assets/img/profile_pic.png)

I am a current Loyola student and data analytics para-professional with over 3 years of proven expertise in biotech and using sterile technique. 

With skills in making professional emails, scheduling important meetings and events, organizing my files, and managing data using Excel and Access, I am able to quickly manipulate and present data, and efficiently tackle biological and coding problems. I am adept at using Excel, Python, ScreenPal, and Microsoft Access. 

My diverse skill set, commitment to hard work, and passion for technology me as a valuable asset.  In my spare time, I like to draw and play video games.

### Projects

#### ScreenPal Presentation

***Summary***

This project is a video presentation where I discuss all the content I learned in CS105 module 1 through 4, encompassing email, scheduling, file systems, computer terminology, binary, etc.

***Report***

Idea:
- I came up with the idea to make a screen recording presentation because it helps me deeply engage with the content I have learned, and it helps me gain additional speaking skills that I will need in the professional world
- I set out to address the problem of how to effectively show what I have learned in modules 1 through 4
- I felt this problem needed to be tackled because modules 1 through 4 had a diverse array of information that can be easily forgotten if I do not re-engage with the content. So to ensure I can remember this content in the long-term, I felt that I had to “teach” this content via ScreenPal to test my memory

Tools:
- I used PowerPoint to present what I learned from modules 1 through 4
- I used ScreenPal to discuss in further detail about what I learned

Challenges:
- My main struggle was sharing the ScreenPal recording with my professor
  - When I originally submitted it, the link I used only lead to a never-ending upload screen, so my professor would not see my work
  - How I overcame it: my teacher extended the due date for the project and I found the proper link format by sharing through the web version of ScreenPal

Outside resources:
- I used Ecosia/YouTube to help figure out how to use certain ScreenPal features

Result
- I set out to create a well-rounded view into my computer science knowledge up to module 4
- I can say confidently that I achieved that goal. My presentation covers all of the content from modules 1-4, and my knowledge of those modules are supported by clear examples. Furthermore, the research I did on comparing Microsoft and Google shows me expanding my knowledge beyond the modules
- If I had the chance to take this further, I would do some more research on other computer science topics and make the slides more presentable by limiting the amount of text on each slide

#### Python Personality Test

***Summary***

This project is a custom personality test designed to match the user to a certain personality (or programming languages in this case) based on simple questions the user answers

### About Me 
![my profile picture](/assets/img/profile_pic.png)

I am a current Loyola student and data analytics para-professional with over 3 years of proven expertise in biotech and using sterile technique. 

With skills in making professional emails, scheduling important meetings and events, organizing my files, and managing data using Excel and Access, I am able to quickly manipulate and present data, and efficiently tackle biological and coding problems. I am adept at using Excel, Python, ScreenPal, and Microsoft Access. 

My diverse skill set, commitment to hard work, and passion for technology me as a valuable asset.  In my spare time, I like to draw and play video games.

### Projects

#### ScreenPal Presentation

***Summary***

This project is a video presentation where I discuss all the content I learned in CS105 module 1 through 4, encompassing email, scheduling, file systems, computer terminology, binary, etc.

***Report***

Idea:
- I came up with the idea to make a screen recording presentation because it helps me deeply engage with the content I have learned, and it helps me gain additional speaking skills that I will need in the professional world
- I set out to address the problem of how to effectively show what I have learned in modules 1 through 4
- I felt this problem needed to be tackled because modules 1 through 4 had a diverse array of information that can be easily forgotten if I do not re-engage with the content. So to ensure I can remember this content in the long-term, I felt that I had to “teach” this content via ScreenPal to test my memory

Tools:
- I used PowerPoint to present what I learned from modules 1 through 4
- I used ScreenPal to discuss in further detail about what I learned

Challenges:
- My main struggle was sharing the ScreenPal recording with my professor
  - When I originally submitted it, the link I used only lead to a never-ending upload screen, so my professor would not see my work
  - How I overcame it: my teacher extended the due date for the project and I found the proper link format by sharing through the web version of ScreenPal

Outside resources:
- I used Ecosia/YouTube to help figure out how to use certain ScreenPal features

Result
- I set out to create a well-rounded view into my computer science knowledge up to module 4
- I can say confidently that I achieved that goal. My presentation covers all of the content from modules 1-4, and my knowledge of those modules are supported by clear examples. Furthermore, the research I did on comparing Microsoft and Google shows me expanding my knowledge beyond the modules
- If I had the chance to take this further, I would do some more research on other computer science topics and make the slides more presentable by limiting the amount of text on each slide

#### Python Personality Test

***Summary***

This project is a custom personality test designed to match the user to a certain personality (or programming languages in this case) based on simple questions the user answers

***Report***

Idea:
- I came up with the idea to make a personality test since I felt that encompassed a lot of what I learned about Python, including error-checking, inputs, typecasting, conditions, and logic
- I set out to address the problem of how to incorporate multiple features of Python into a functional project
- I felt that this was a problem that needed to be solved because if I never tested all of my Python knowledge, then I would not learn anything and would simply forget about every feature of Python more quickly

Tools:
- I used the built-in Python 3 environment in JDoodle to complete this project

Challenges:
- The main challenge I faced was ensuring the personality result was correct, as when I tested it, the program gave me a different result than what was intended
- How I overcame it:
  - I rearranged the if statements to ensure the hybrid personalities would be printed out correctly
  - I added a second condition to ensure that a personality will not be triggered if two-character traits were equal to 0 (which would give me an unintended personality)

Outside resources:
- I do not remember using outside resources to help with this project

Result:
- I set out to create a neat, functional personality test that gives accurate results depending on the input
- I can say that I achieved this goal. The outputs and prompts are cleanly formatted, and after intense testing, the personality test will print out the correct personality
- If I could take this further, I would add more questions to create a more nuanced, well-rounded test and figure out how to optimize my code

#### Microsoft Access Student Transcripts

***Summary***

This project is composed of two Microsoft Access reports that display the grades for two college students’ classes (by semester), averages for each semester, and the overall average grade

***Report***

Idea:
- I came up with the idea to make school transcripts because they are great examples of effectively displaying data
- I set out to address the problem of how I could take data from Microsoft Access queries and make them presentable
- I feel like this was a problem that needed to be solved because making reports are crucial to surviving in the professional world. CEOs and the average person cannot understand queries and relationships in databases, so reports allow them to understand your work and indicate you know what you are doing

Tools:
- I used Microsoft Access 2019 through a virtual desktop service called Apporto to complete this project

Challenges:
- My biggest challenge in this project was submitting the transcript PDFs to Moodle
  - Since Apporto did not allow me to upload to OneDrive for some reason, my reports seemed trapped in the virtual desktop
  - How I overcame it
    - My Apporto virtual desktop had Google Chrome embedded inside
    - To transfer to my real desktop, I navigated to the virtual desktop’s Chrome, signed in using my Gmail account, and uploaded the PDFs to Google Drive
    - Then, I navigated to Google Drive on my real desktop and downloaded the PDFs to my desktop

Other resources:
- I occasionally used the “Help” feature in Access if I was stumped on how to find or do something

Result:
- I set out to create a report that is well organized and can accurately calculate grade averages
- I can say that I achieved this
  - The report is nicely broken up by semester, and all the classes are arranged as blocks
  - I verified all of the calculated averages before I submitted the reports, so I am mostly confident that the averages are accurate
- If I could take this further, I would try to experiment more with the report design to make it more tailored to my personality and interests
